    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey! I'm Kevin. This website is still very much in progress but eventually will serve as a personal website.</p>
    <p>I use the nickname "Majekdor" or sometimes just "Majek" for most of my online profiles and accounts that relate to development.</p>
    <p>I'm a full time college student studing computer engineering who also enjoys programming. I maintain a few Minecraft plugins and random other things.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to contact me, the best way is via my <a href="https://discord.gg/CGgvDUz">Discord</a> server.
      After you join, you can post in one of the channels or message me directly. If you want to message me directly that's fine,
      but please don't send me a friend request, it's not necessary. If you don't have Discord you're also welcome to
      <a href="mailto:me@kevbarnes.com">email</a> me.</p>
    <p>You can find me (most actively) on GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/majekdor">@Majekdor</a>.</p>
